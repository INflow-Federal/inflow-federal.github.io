Given the size and scale of many of the documents we're meant to read and comprehend, we want to ensure that our time is being allocated to those focused primarily in the same focus and capability areas that we as a company are looking to grow into, which led to this quick side project for us to extract relevant terms and their frequencies in documents using a TFIDF (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm.

## Getting Started

# Usage

If you want to try this out for yourself, clone the [source code](https://github.com/INflow-Federal/contract-analysis) repository on our GitHub and open the jupyter notebook in your conda environment in terminal using `jupyter notebook contract-analysis.ipynb`. Any questions? Feel free to [contact us](mailto:labs@inflowfed.com) and ask away.
